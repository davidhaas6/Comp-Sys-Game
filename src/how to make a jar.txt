How to make an executable Jar file for our game

1. File -> Project Structure -> Project Settings -> Artifacts -> Jar -> From modules with dependencies...
2. Select Client.GameClient as the main class
3. Extract to the target Jar
4. OK
5. Build -> Build Artifacts -> Select Jar -> Build
6. Move the Jar file from /out/artifacts/[jar name]/ to the project directory (the same folder where src and resources are in)
7. Run the Jar
8. Yay!

N.B. This process needs to be redone starting from step 5 if you wish for your Jar file to reflect any changes to the code you've made since last building the Jar
